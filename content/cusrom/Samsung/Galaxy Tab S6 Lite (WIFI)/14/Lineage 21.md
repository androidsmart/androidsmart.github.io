Download Custom Rom LineageOS 21 Android 14 Samsung Galaxy Tab S6 Lite (WIFI)

## Installing LineageOS 21 on the Samsung Galaxy Tab S6 Lite (WiFi)

LineageOS 21 is an unofficial custom ROM that can be installed on the Samsung Galaxy Tab S6 Lite (WiFi) to replace the stock operating system. It offers an alternative Android experience with potentially better performance, more customization options, and freedom from bloatware. However, installing a custom ROM requires technical knowledge and carries some risks, so proceed with caution.

**Here's a breakdown of the process:**

**Important Note:** There are separate versions of LineageOS 21 for the 2020 and 2022 models of the Galaxy Tab S6 Lite (WiFi). Make sure you identify the correct model before proceeding.

**1. Check Model Compatibility:**

* Verify if you have the 2020 (SM-P610) or 2022 model of the Galaxy Tab S6 Lite (WiFi).

**2. Backup Data:**

* Unlocking the bootloader and installing a custom ROM will erase all your data. Back up your important files, contacts, and messages before proceeding.

**3. Unlock Bootloader:**

* Unlocking the bootloader allows flashing custom ROMs. This process varies slightly depending on the model year. Search for specific instructions for your model on XDA Forums [URL yang tidak valid dihapus].

**4. Download ROM and Recovery:**

* Download the LineageOS 21 ROM and recovery image compatible with your specific Galaxy Tab S6 Lite model (WiFi) from trusted sources like XDA Forums.

**5. Flash ROM and Recovery:**

* With the bootloader unlocked, use Odin or other flashing tools to flash the downloaded recovery image and then the LineageOS 21 ROM zip file. Specific instructions can be found on XDA Forums.

**6. GApps (Optional):**

* If you want Google apps and services like Play Store, you can optionally flash a package called GApps after installing LineageOS.


**Remember:** Installing custom ROMs can be risky. Make sure you understand the process and  the potential risks involved before attempting it.
