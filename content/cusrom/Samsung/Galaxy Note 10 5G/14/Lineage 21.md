Download Custom Rom LineageOS 21 Android 14 Samsung Galaxy Note 10 Plus 5G (d2x)

The Samsung Galaxy Note 10 Plus 5G was a powerful phone released in 2019. But even high-end devices eventually fall behind on the latest software updates. LineageOS 21 offers a way to extend the life of your Note 10 Plus 5G by giving it a taste of Android 14.

## What is LineageOS?

LineageOS is a free, open-source operating system based on Android. It's a popular choice for users who want a clean, bloatware-free experience with more customization options than stock Android.

## LineageOS 21 on the Note 10 Plus 5G

LineageOS 21 is an unofficial build for the Galaxy Note 10 Plus 5G. This means it's not officially supported by Samsung, but it's developed and maintained by a community of developers.

## Benefits of LineageOS 21

* **Android 14:** Experience the latest features and security updates of Android 14.
* **Improved Performance:** LineageOS is known for being faster and more lightweight than stock Android.
* **Customization:** You have more control over the look and feel of your phone.
* **No Bloatware:** LineageOS comes free of pre-installed apps you don't want.

## Things to Consider

* **Unofficial Build:** Since it's unofficial, there's a chance you might encounter bugs or stability issues.
* **Installation Difficulty:** Installing LineageOS requires flashing the ROM, which can be a complex process for beginners.
* **Loss of Warranty:** Flashing a custom ROM may void your phone's warranty.

## Is LineageOS 21 Right for You?

If you're a power user who wants the latest software and maximum control over your phone, LineageOS 21 is a great option for your Galaxy Note 10 Plus 5G. However, if you're not comfortable with flashing ROMs or prefer a stable, user-friendly experience, you might want to stick with stock Android.

## Getting Started with LineageOS 21

Before flashing LineageOS 21, make sure to back up your phone completely. You'll also need to unlock your bootloader and install a custom recovery like TWRP.  In-depth instructions and download links can be found on forums like XDA ([https://xdaforums.com/c/samsung-galaxy-note-10.9147/](https://xdaforums.com/c/samsung-galaxy-note-10.9147/)).

**Remember, installing LineageOS carries some risk. Proceed with caution and at your own responsibility.**
