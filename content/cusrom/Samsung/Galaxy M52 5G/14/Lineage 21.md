Download Custom Rom LineageOS 21 Android 14 Samsung Galaxy M52 5G (m52xq)

The Samsung Galaxy M52 5G can be revitalized with a custom ROM like LineageOS 21, offering an experience closer to stock Android. Here's what you need to know:

## LineageOS 21 Availability

LineageOS 21 for the M52 5G (codename m52xq) is currently in the **nightly build stage**. This means it's a development version and might have bugs or stability issues. While there's no official LineageOS 21 channel yet, you can find nightly builds for download on the LineageOS website: [LineageOS Downloads for m52xq].

## Samsung Galaxy M52 5G Won't Get Official LineageOS 21

According to the Samsung community forums, the Galaxy M52 5G is unlikely to receive an official LineageOS 21 release ([Samsung Members community]). This could be due to various reasons, like hardware limitations or lack of developer interest.

## Benefits of LineageOS 21

* **Stock Android Experience:** LineageOS removes Samsung's custom UI (One UI) and bloatware, offering a clean and lightweight Android experience.
* **Android 14 Support:** LineageOS 21 is based on Android 14, providing access to the latest features and security updates that Samsung might not deliver anymore.
* **Customization:** LineageOS provides a variety of customization options, allowing you to personalize your phone's look and feel.

## Things to Consider

* **Nightly Builds:** Using nightly builds requires technical knowledge and comes with the risk of encountering bugs or instability.
* **Warranty:** Installing a custom ROM might void your phone's warranty.
* **Technical Expertise:** Flashing a custom ROM requires following specific instructions and using tools that might be unfamiliar to beginners.

## Conclusion

LineageOS 21 offers an exciting way to experience the latest Android version (Android 14) and a stock Android feel on your Samsung Galaxy M52 5G. However,  be aware of the limitations of nightly builds and the technical expertise needed for installation.  Before proceeding, carefully consider these factors and ensure you have a backup of your phone's data.
