The Samsung Galaxy Note 9, released in 2018, is a powerful device that can still hold its own in 2024. But if you're feeling like your phone's software is outdated and sluggish, LineageOS 21 can be a game-changer.

LineageOS is a popular custom ROM (operating system) that offers a clean, near-stock Android experience. LineageOS 21 is based on Android 13, giving your Note 9 access to the latest features and security patches.

* **Warranty:** Installing a custom ROM voids your phone's warranty.
