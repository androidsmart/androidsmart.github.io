The OnePlus 7T, a popular flagship device from 2019, still holds its ground with powerful hardware and a sleek design. However, if you're looking to breathe new life into your device and enjoy the latest Android features, LineageOS 21 is a compelling option.

**What is LineageOS 21?**

LineageOS 21 is a free and open-source operating system based on Android 14, designed to offer a near-stock Android experience with enhanced privacy, customization, and performance optimizations. It is the successor to LineageOS 20 and brings a plethora of new features and improvements to your OnePlus 7T.

**Why Choose LineageOS 21 for Your OnePlus 7T?**
