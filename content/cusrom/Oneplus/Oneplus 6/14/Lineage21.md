LineageOS 21 on OnePlus 6: Breathing New Life into a Flagship Phone

The OnePlus 6, despite its age, remains a capable flagship phone. However, as with all Android devices, official software support eventually ceases. This is where LineageOS 21 comes into play, breathing new life into this older model by providing an updated and customizable Android experience.

**What is LineageOS 21?**

LineageOS 21 is a free and open-source operating system based on Android 14, designed to run on various smartphones and tablets. It's a community-driven project known for its focus on performance, stability, and privacy, offering a cleaner and more customizable experience compared to stock Android.

**Why Install LineageOS 21 on Your OnePlus 6?**
