## Compatibility and Installation

LineageOS 21 supports a wide range of Android devices, including the Pocopad. Before proceeding with the installation, it's crucial to:

## Important Considerations

Installing LineageOS 21 is a technical process that requires careful attention to detail. Ensure you follow the instructions precisely to avoid potential issues. If you're unsure about any step, seek guidance from experienced users or developers.

**Disclaimer:** Flashing LineageOS or any custom ROM carries inherent risks. Proceed with caution and understand that you are solely responsible for any modifications made to your device.

## Conclusion
