## How to Install DerpFest Android 15 on Mi Pad 4

Before proceeding, remember that installing a custom ROM requires unlocking the bootloader and installing a custom recovery like TWRP. **This process will wipe your data, so make sure to back up everything important.**

1. **Download the ROM:** Head over to the DerpFest website or XDA forums to download the latest Android 15 build for the Mi Pad 4.

3. **Boot into Recovery:** Reboot your Mi Pad 4 into TWRP recovery.
4. **Wipe Data:** Perform a factory reset and wipe the cache partition.
5. **Install ROM and GApps:** Flash the DerpFest ROM zip file, followed by the GApps package.
6. **Reboot:** Reboot your device and enjoy DerpFest Android 15 on your Mi Pad 4!

## Important Notes

* Always double-check compatibility and download files from official sources to avoid issues.
* The installation process might vary slightly depending on your specific device and DerpFest version. Refer to the official DerpFest or XDA threads for detailed instructions.
* While DerpFest is generally stable, custom ROMs can sometimes have bugs. Be prepared to troubleshoot if necessary.

## Conclusion
