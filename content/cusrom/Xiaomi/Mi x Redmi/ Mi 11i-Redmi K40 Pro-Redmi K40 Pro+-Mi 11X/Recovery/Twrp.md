  * Proceed with caution and follow the instructions carefully. We are not responsible for any damage caused to your device.

## Prerequisites

## Installation Steps

1.  **Boot into Fastboot Mode:**

      - Press and hold the Volume Down button and the Power button simultaneously until the Fastboot logo appears on the screen.

2.  **Connect to Computer:**
