  * **Install custom ROMs:** Explore a world of custom Android experiences beyond MIUI.
  * **Create and restore backups:** Secure your data with comprehensive backups.
  * **Flash ZIP files:** Install mods, kernels, and other enhancements.
  * **Wipe data:** Perform factory resets and selective data wipes.
  * **Advanced troubleshooting:** Fix potential software issues.

## Prerequisites

  * **Unlocked Bootloader:** Unlocking your bootloader is essential for installing TWRP. Refer to official Xiaomi resources or community forums for guidance on unlocking the bootloader for your specific device model.

  * **TWRP Image:** Download the latest TWRP image specifically designed for the Xiaomi 15 Pro from the official TWRP website or trusted sources like XDA Developers.
