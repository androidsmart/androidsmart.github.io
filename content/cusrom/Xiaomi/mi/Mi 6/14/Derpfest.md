The Xiaomi Mi 6, a phone that has defied obsolescence for years, is receiving a new lease on life thanks to the DerpFest custom ROM and its Android 14 update. This development is a testament to both the enduring popularity of the Mi 6 and the dedication of the DerpFest community.

## Breathing New Life into a Legend

The Mi 6, despite its age, remains a beloved device for many due to its compact size, solid build quality, and impressive performance for its time.

* **Improved performance:**  Smoother animations, faster app launches, and better overall responsiveness.
* **Refreshed user interface:**  A more modern and visually appealing look and feel.
* **New accessibility features:**  Making Android more accessible to users with disabilities.
