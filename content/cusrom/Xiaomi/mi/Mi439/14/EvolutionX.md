**What is Evolution X?**

Evolution X is a popular custom ROM known for its stability, performance, and customization options. It's based on the Android Open Source Project (AOSP), so it delivers a near-stock Android experience similar to Google Pixel devices, with a few extra features and optimizations to enhance your phone's capabilities.

**How to Install Evolution X on Redmi 8:**

1. **Unlock Bootloader:**  First, unlock your Redmi 8's bootloader. This allows you to install custom software.
2. **Install Custom Recovery:** Flash a custom recovery like TWRP (Team Win Recovery Project) onto your phone. This will enable you to install the ROM.
3. **Download Evolution X:** Download the latest Evolution X build specifically for the Redmi 8 from the official XDA forums or the Evolution X website.
4. **Flash ROM and GApps:** Boot into TWRP recovery, wipe your phone's data, then flash the downloaded ROM file. If you want Google apps, flash the corresponding GApps package as well.

**Important Considerations:**

* **Warranty:** Installing a custom ROM will void your phone's warranty.
