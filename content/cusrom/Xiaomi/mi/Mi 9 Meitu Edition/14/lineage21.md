## Upgrading Xiaomi Mi 9 Meitu Edition to LineageOS 21: A Comprehensive Guide

The Xiaomi Mi 9 Meitu Edition is a powerful device known for its camera capabilities. While it comes with MIUI, some users prefer a cleaner and more customizable Android experience. LineageOS 21, based on Android 11, provides exactly that, along with several performance and security enhancements. This guide will walk you through the process of installing LineageOS 21 on your Mi 9 Meitu Edition, turning it into a more personalized and efficient device.

## Preparations Before You Begin

* **Backup:** Create a complete backup of your data. Unlocking the bootloader and installing a custom ROM will erase all data on your device.
* **Unlock Bootloader:** Follow Xiaomi's official instructions to unlock the bootloader of your Mi 9 Meitu Edition. This is a crucial step before installing custom software.
* **Install Custom Recovery:** After unlocking the bootloader, install a custom recovery like TWRP (Team Win Recovery Project). This will enable you to flash LineageOS and other custom files.
* **Download Files:** Download the latest LineageOS 21 build for the Mi 9 Meitu Edition (codename "cepheus") from the official LineageOS website. Also, download the corresponding GApps package if you want to use Google applications.

## Installation Steps

1. **Transfer Files:** Transfer the downloaded LineageOS and GApps zip files to your phone's internal storage or an external SD card.
2. **Boot into Recovery:** Reboot your Mi 9 Meitu Edition into recovery mode (TWRP).
3. **Wipe Data:** In TWRP, wipe data, cache, and dalvik cache. This will ensure a clean installation.
4. **Flash LineageOS:** Select "Install" in TWRP and navigate to the LineageOS zip file. Swipe to confirm the installation.
5. **Flash GApps:** After LineageOS is installed, repeat the process to flash the GApps package.
6. **Reboot:** Reboot your device. The first boot may take some time, so be patient.

## Advantages of LineageOS 21

* **Stock Android Experience:** LineageOS offers a clean and bloatware-free Android experience, similar to Google Pixel devices.
* **Customization:** You can customize various aspects of the interface, including themes, fonts, and icons.
