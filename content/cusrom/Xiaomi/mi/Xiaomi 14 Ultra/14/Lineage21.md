Download Custom Rom LineAge 21 OS Android 14 Xiaomi 14 Ultra (aurora).

For the Xiaomi 14 Ultra, the unofficial version of LineageOS 21 based on Android 14 is currently in development. While the custom ROM is in a beta stage, several features are operational, though there are still some issues.

## Key features

Most basic functions are working, but there might be problems with video playback and notifications being laggy.

Some users report UI performance concerns, such as the notification bar and settings menu running slowly.

If you are planning to install this ROM, note that you may experience random system interface freezes. Developers continue to work on these issues and aim for further updates​​​​.


## For flashing LineageOS

1. Unlock the bootloader of your Xiaomi 14 Ultra.


2. Install a custom recovery like TWRP.


3. Flash the LineageOS 21 ROM and, optionally, a compatible GApps package.


4. Some users suggest flashing GApps after booting into the ROM, rather than at the same time, to avoid issues.


Make sure to backup your data before installation, as this is a non-stable release. Keep an eye on forums like XDA for updates and troubleshooting tips​​​​.
