Download Custom Rom Lineage OS 21 Android 14 For Xiaomi Mi Mix 2s (Polaris)

The Xiaomi Mi MIX 2S, despite its age, remains a capable device with its powerful Snapdragon 845 processor and sleek design. However, its software experience might feel outdated. Enter LineageOS 21, a custom ROM based on Android 11, which breathes new life into the Mi MIX 2S by offering a pure Android experience, improved performance, enhanced security, and customization options.

## Why Choose LineageOS 21 for Your Mi MIX 2S?

* **Pure Android Experience:** LineageOS strips away the unnecessary bloatware often found in manufacturer-specific skins, providing a clean and streamlined Android experience.
* **Performance Boost:** Without the burden of bloatware, LineageOS 21 can significantly improve the overall responsiveness and speed of your Mi MIX 2S.
* **Enhanced Security:** LineageOS prioritizes security and regularly releases updates to patch vulnerabilities and protect your device from potential threats.
* **Customization Galore:** LineageOS offers extensive customization options, allowing you to tailor the look, feel, and functionality of your device to your preferences.
* **Vibrant Community:** The LineageOS community is active and supportive, offering help and guidance throughout the installation process and beyond.

## Installation Guide

1. **Unlocking the Bootloader:** The first step is to unlock the bootloader of your Mi MIX 2S. This process varies depending on your device's model and software version. Refer to official guides or online forums for detailed instructions specific to your device.
2. **Installing Custom Recovery:** Once the bootloader is unlocked, install a custom recovery like TWRP (Team Win Recovery Project). This tool is essential for flashing LineageOS and other custom ROMs.
3. **Downloading LineageOS and GApps:** Download the latest LineageOS 21 build for your Mi MIX 2S (codename: polaris) from the official LineageOS website. If you want to use Google apps and services, also download the appropriate GApps package.
4. **Flashing LineageOS and GApps:** Boot into TWRP recovery and create a backup of your current system. Then, wipe the data, cache, and dalvik cache partitions. Finally, flash the LineageOS zip file, followed by the GApps zip file.
5. **Rebooting and Enjoying:** Reboot your device, and you should be greeted with the LineageOS 21 boot animation. The initial boot might take some time, but once it's complete, you can start exploring and customizing your revitalized Mi MIX 2S.

## Important Considerations

* **Warranty:** Unlocking the bootloader and installing a custom ROM might void your device's warranty. Proceed at your own risk.
* **Data Backup:** Always create a backup of your important data before flashing any custom software.
* **Thorough Research:** Research the installation process thoroughly and make sure you have the correct files for your Mi MIX 2S model.
* **Community Support:** Don't hesitate to seek help from the LineageOS community if you encounter any issues during or after installation.

## Conclusion

LineageOS 21 breathes new life into the Xiaomi Mi MIX 2S, offering a refreshed and optimized Android experience. With its pure Android interface, improved performance, enhanced security, and customization options, LineageOS is an excellent way to extend the lifespan of your device and rediscover its full potential.
