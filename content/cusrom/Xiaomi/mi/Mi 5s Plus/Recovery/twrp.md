4. **Connect to Computer:** Connect your Mi 5s to your computer using a USB cable.
5. **Flash TWRP Image:** Open a command prompt or terminal window and navigate to the directory where you saved the TWRP image. Then, execute the following command: `fastboot flash recovery twrp-x.x.x-x-capricorn.img` (replace `twrp-x.x.x-x-capricorn.img` with the actual filename of your TWRP image).
6. **Reboot into Recovery:** Once the flashing process is complete, use the volume buttons to navigate and the power button to select "Recovery" from the fastboot menu. Your Mi 5s should boot into TWRP.

**Important Note:** Installing TWRP and making modifications to your device's system software involves inherent risks. Proceed with caution, back up your data, and ensure you follow reliable instructions to avoid potential issues.
