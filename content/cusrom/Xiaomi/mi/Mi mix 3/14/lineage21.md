The Xiaomi Mi Mix 3, once a flagship device, can be given a new lease on life with LineageOS 21. This custom ROM, based on Android 11, breathes new life into the device, offering a clean, customizable, and bloatware-free experience. 

## What is LineageOS 21?

LineageOS is a free and open-source operating system for various devices, based on the Android mobile platform. It is a continuation of the CyanogenMod project, which was discontinued in December 2016. LineageOS provides a stock Android experience with additional features and customization options.

## Why Choose LineageOS 21 for Mi Mix 3?

2. **Performance Boost:** Without the extra baggage of bloatware, LineageOS often results in improved performance and responsiveness on older devices like the Mi Mix 3.
3. **Customization:** LineageOS offers a wide range of customization options, allowing you to tailor the look and feel of your device to your preferences.
4. **Privacy and Security:** LineageOS is known for its focus on privacy and security, providing regular security updates and patches.
5. **Community Support:** LineageOS has a vibrant community of developers and users who actively contribute to the development and support of the project.

## Installation Guide

1. **Download:** Download the LineageOS 21 build and the appropriate GApps package (if you want Google apps) for your Mi Mix 3 model.
2. **Backup:** Create a complete backup of your data as this process will wipe your device.
3. **Boot into Recovery:** Reboot your device into TWRP recovery mode.
