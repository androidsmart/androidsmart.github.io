# How to Install TWRP Recovery on Xiaomi 14

Installing TWRP (Team Win Recovery Project) on your Xiaomi 14 provides advanced recovery options, the ability to flash custom ROMs, and additional control over your device. **Important Note:** This process requires unlocking the bootloader, which may void your warranty and erase all data. Ensure you back up any important information before starting.

## Requirements
1. **Unlock the Bootloader**: The bootloader must be unlocked to install TWRP. You will need to apply for unlock permission from Xiaomi and wait for approval.
2. **Install ADB and Fastboot**: Download and install the ADB and Fastboot tools on your computer. These allow your computer to communicate with your Xiaomi 14.
3. **Download the TWRP Image for Xiaomi 14**: Make sure to download the correct TWRP image for the Xiaomi 14 model.

## Installation Steps

### Step 1: Unlock the Bootloader
1. **Enable Developer Options**: Go to **Settings > About phone > MIUI version** and tap multiple times until you see "You are now a developer."
2. **Enable OEM Unlocking**: Go to **Settings > Additional settings > Developer options**, and enable **OEM unlocking** and **USB debugging**.
3. **Request Bootloader Unlock Permission**: Download the **Mi Unlock Tool** on your computer and sign in with the same Mi account used on your phone. Follow the instructions in the tool to apply for bootloader unlock permission.
4. **Unlock the Bootloader**: Once approved, use the Mi Unlock Tool to unlock the bootloader. This process will erase all data on your device, so ensure all important files are backed up.

### Step 2: Enter Fastboot Mode
1. Turn off your Xiaomi 14.
2. Press and hold **Volume Down** and **Power** together until the Fastboot logo appears on the screen.

### Step 3: Flash the TWRP Image
1. **Connect Your Device to the Computer**: Use a USB cable to connect the Xiaomi 14 to your computer.
2. **Open Command Prompt/Terminal**: On your computer, navigate to the folder where you downloaded the TWRP image. Open a Command Prompt or Terminal window in this folder.
3. **Flash TWRP**:
   - Confirm your device is recognized by running:
     ```bash
     fastboot devices
     ```
   - Flash the TWRP image by running:
     ```bash
     fastboot flash recovery <twrp-image-filename>.img
     ```
   - Replace `<twrp-image-filename>` with the actual name of the TWRP image file.

### Step 4: Boot into TWRP Recovery
1. After flashing TWRP, you can boot directly into TWRP by running:
   ```bash
   fastboot boot <twrp-image-filename>.img

2. Once in TWRP, swipe to allow modifications when prompted.



Step 5: Install TWRP Permanently (Optional)

If TWRP doesnâ€™t persist after a reboot, you may need to install it permanently. In TWRP, select Install, then locate and select the TWRP image file to flash it again to the Recovery partition.


Step 6: Reboot to System

After installation, reboot your device by selecting Reboot > System in TWRP.


Important Notes

Data Backup: Unlocking the bootloader will erase all data, so make sure to back up your important information.

OTA Updates: Installing TWRP may prevent automatic installation of future OTA updates from Xiaomi.

Rooting: If you want to root your Xiaomi 14, you can flash Magisk through TWRP after installation.


Following these steps, your Xiaomi 14 should now have TWRP installed, enabling custom recovery and modification capabilities.
