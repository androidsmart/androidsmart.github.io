Download Custom Rom Pixelage OS android 14  for Xiaomi 14 (houji).

Pixelage is a custom ROM based on Android 14 that brings a stock Pixel experience to other devices, like the Xiaomi 14. By installing Pixelage, you can enjoy Google’s latest Android 14 features along with the clean, responsive design of the Pixel UI. **Important Note:** Installing custom ROMs requires an unlocked bootloader and custom recovery, which can void your warranty and may lead to data loss. Backup all important data before proceeding.

## Prerequisites
1. **Unlocked Bootloader**: Ensure that the bootloader on your Xiaomi 14 is unlocked. Refer to the Xiaomi guidelines on how to unlock the bootloader.
2. **Custom Recovery (TWRP)**: TWRP (or another compatible recovery) must be installed to flash custom ROMs. See our guide on [installing TWRP on Xiaomi 14](#).
3. **Pixelage ROM for Xiaomi 14**: Download the correct Pixelage ROM version for the Xiaomi 14. Ensure compatibility with your model.

## Preparation Steps
1. **Backup Your Data**: Unlocking the bootloader and installing a custom ROM will wipe your data. Use Google Backup or another backup method to save your data.
2. **Charge Your Device**: Ensure your Xiaomi 14 has at least 50% battery to avoid interruptions during the installation.

## Installation Steps

### Step 1: Download Required Files
1. **Pixelage ROM**: Download the Pixelage Android 14 ROM file specific to Xiaomi 14 and save it to your computer.
2. **Google Apps (GApps)**: Some custom ROMs do not come with Google apps (Gmail, Play Store, etc.) pre-installed. Download a compatible GApps package if needed.

### Step 2: Boot into TWRP Recovery
1. Power off your Xiaomi 14.
2. Press and hold **Volume Up** and **Power** buttons together until the TWRP logo appears.

### Step 3: Wipe Existing Data
1. In TWRP, go to **Wipe > Advanced Wipe**.
2. Select **Dalvik/ART Cache**, **System**, **Data**, and **Cache**. Swipe to confirm.
3. **Note**: Do not select **Internal Storage** unless you have already backed up your data elsewhere.

### Step 4: Flash Pixelage ROM
1. Return to the TWRP main screen, and select **Install**.
2. Navigate to the Pixelage ROM zip file you downloaded, select it, and swipe to start the installation.
3. Wait for the installation process to complete. It may take a few minutes.

### Step 5: Flash Google Apps (Optional)
1. If your Pixelage ROM requires a GApps package, go back to the **Install** menu in TWRP.
2. Select the GApps zip file and swipe to flash.
3. Wait for the process to complete.

### Step 6: Reboot Your Device
1. After both Pixelage and GApps are installed, return to the TWRP main menu.
2. Select **Reboot > System**.
3. The first boot may take several minutes as the new system initializes.

## Troubleshooting Tips
- **Boot Loop**: If your Xiaomi 14 gets stuck in a boot loop, re-enter TWRP and try wiping the **Dalvik/ART Cache** and **Cache**, then reboot.
- **Missing Google Apps**: If GApps don’t appear, confirm you downloaded the correct version and flash it again in TWRP.

## Important Notes
- **OTA Updates**: Pixelage may not support OTA updates. You might need to install updates manually by repeating this process with the latest ROM version.
- **Warranty**: Installing custom ROMs usually voids the device warranty. Make sure you understand the risks before proceeding.

By following these steps, you can successfully install Pixelage Android 14 on your Xiaomi 14, bringing the Pixel experience and the latest Android 14 features to your device.
