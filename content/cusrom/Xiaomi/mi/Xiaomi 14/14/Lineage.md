Download Custom Rom Lineage 21 OS android 14  for Xiaomi 14 (houji).

LineageOS 21 is a custom ROM based on Android 14, providing a clean, customizable Android experience while focusing on privacy and minimalism. Installing LineageOS on your Xiaomi 14 can unlock Android 14’s latest features without bloatware. **Note:** This process requires an unlocked bootloader and a custom recovery like TWRP. Be aware that installing custom ROMs can void your warranty and will erase all data, so back up any important data before starting.

## Requirements
1. **Unlocked Bootloader**: The bootloader must be unlocked on your Xiaomi 14. Follow Xiaomi’s official guide on how to unlock it.
2. **Custom Recovery (TWRP)**: TWRP or another compatible recovery must be installed on your device to flash LineageOS. Refer to our [TWRP installation guide for Xiaomi 14](#).
3. **Download LineageOS 21 ROM**: Make sure to download the official LineageOS 21 ROM for Xiaomi 14, compatible with Android 14.

## Preparation Steps
1. **Back Up Your Data**: Unlocking the bootloader and flashing a new ROM will wipe all data. Use Google Backup or another backup tool.
2. **Charge Your Device**: Ensure your battery level is above 50% to prevent interruptions during the installation.

## Installation Steps

### Step 1: Download Necessary Files
1. **LineageOS 21 ROM**: Download the LineageOS 21 (Android 14) ROM file specifically for Xiaomi 14 and save it on your computer.
2. **Google Apps (GApps)**: LineageOS does not include Google Apps by default. If you need apps like Google Play, download a compatible GApps package for Android 14.

### Step 2: Boot into TWRP Recovery
1. Power off your Xiaomi 14.
2. Press and hold **Volume Up** and **Power** buttons together until the TWRP recovery screen appears.

### Step 3: Wipe Existing Data
1. In TWRP, go to **Wipe > Advanced Wipe**.
2. Select **Dalvik/ART Cache**, **System**, **Data**, and **Cache**. Swipe to confirm.
3. **Note**: Do not select **Internal Storage** unless you have already backed up your data externally.

### Step 4: Flash LineageOS ROM
1. Return to the TWRP main menu and select **Install**.
2. Locate the LineageOS 21 ROM zip file, select it, and swipe to start the installation.
3. Wait for the installation to complete, which may take a few minutes.

### Step 5: Flash Google Apps (Optional)
1. If you need Google services, go back to **Install** in TWRP.
2. Select the GApps zip file and swipe to flash.
3. Wait for the installation to finish.

### Step 6: Reboot to System
1. After flashing both LineageOS and GApps (if needed), return to the TWRP main menu.
2. Select **Reboot > System**.
3. The first boot may take several minutes as the system sets up.

## Troubleshooting Tips
- **Boot Loop**: If your Xiaomi 14 gets stuck in a boot loop, return to TWRP, wipe **Dalvik/ART Cache** and **Cache**, then reboot.
- **Google Apps Not Appearing**: If Google apps are missing, double-check the GApps version and try flashing it again in TWRP.

## Important Considerations
- **OTA Updates**: LineageOS may offer OTA updates, but you may need to manually update by flashing newer ROM versions.
- **Warranty**: Installing custom ROMs can void your device’s warranty. Proceed with caution.

Following this guide, you should be able to install LineageOS 21 based on Android 14 on your Xiaomi 14, enjoying a minimalist, customizable Android experience with the latest features.
