## Notes

Screenshots | Screenshots of the ROM
1. You can use any Recovery. SKKK TWRP is always recommended. Firmware not included. Flash latest Regional FW.
2. Vanilla Build - NikGApps are always recommended. You can flash NikGApps on my builds without any doubt or confirmation. You can flash any variant. Here's my custom build of NikGApps.
3. n0kernel KSU by default. You can also flash Magisk or Kitsune Mask. You're free to use any other kernel. Remember some kernel doesn't support DC Dimming, KProfiles, HBM, etc. so don't be shocked if those features are disabled in ROM or doesn't work. They require kernel side support.
4. Included - Moto Dolby, Spatial Audio, QS Tile for FPS, Refresh Rate, and Thermal Profile, Per App Maximum Refresh Rate, Clear Speaker, Thermal Profiles, ViPER4AndroidFX, HBM and Auto HBM, DC Dimming, High Touch Polling Rate, KProfiles, Battery Health, Live Display, Pocket Mode, Lineage Charging Control, Touch Feature in Thermal Profiles for Gaming and Benchmarking, Refresh Rate Settings, Leica 5.0, Dirac.
5. Excluded - Dolby Vision.
6. Bugs - ViLTE, etc.
7. Report Kernel Specific bugs here.
8. Report ROM Source Specific bugs here.
9. Don't report device specific bugs. Consider switching ROM as I won't entertain any bug (s). PMs will be ignored. Don't expect any update in future. ROM is similar to all other ROMs out there, nothing different. If you want update in future then arrange server for 1-2 days.
10. Thanks to @Bhairav11 & @lighthousekona for testing multiple builds.
11. Flash Hotfix build only if you are facing this bug and improper colours in Instagram Reels or Facebook Reels/Videos. Otherwise skip it.
12. Fix for call recording? You need to be rooted. Install LSPosed then install Lucky Patcher from here and do these settings in LP and then reboot. After rebooting simply install this apk from LP as system App. Done! Now not only call recording will work but you'll get an option of auto call recording as well.
13. Gaming? Change Kernel to RK AOSP 14.8 and Flash this Module. Check sample here!
14. Do this if you use ROM for longer durations and feel micro lags or any such issue.
15. Play Integrity Fail? Use this!
