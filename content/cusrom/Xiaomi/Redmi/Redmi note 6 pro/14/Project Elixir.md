The Redmi Note 6 Pro, while a capable mid-range device in its time, may feel dated with its older Android version. Enter Project Elixir, a custom ROM based on Android 14, offering a rejuvenating experience for this classic phone.

**What is Project Elixir?**

Project Elixir is a custom Android ROM known for its minimalist UI enhancements and emphasis on performance, security, and stability. Built on the Android Open Source Project (AOSP), it aims to provide a near-stock Android experience with subtle refinements.

5. **Customization Options:** While maintaining a stock-like feel, Project Elixir offers a degree of customization through themes, fonts, and other system-level tweaks.

**Things to Consider Before Installing**
