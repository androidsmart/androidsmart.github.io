HyperOS is Xiaomi's latest Android skin, succeeding MIUI. It boasts performance improvements, a refreshed UI, and enhanced privacy features. While official support is limited to newer devices, resourceful developers have ported it to the Redmi Note 7, offering a taste of the latest Android experience.
