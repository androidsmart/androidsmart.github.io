## Advantages of TWRP Recovery

* **Custom ROM Installation:** TWRP empowers you to install a wide array of custom ROMs, tailoring your Redmi 12's appearance, features, and performance to your preferences.

## Installation of TWRP Recovery on Xiaomi Redmi 12

**Prerequisites:**

* **Unlocked Bootloader:** Ensure that your Xiaomi Redmi 12's bootloader is unlocked before proceeding.
* **Back Up Your Data:** It's crucial to back up all your important data as this process will erase everything on your device.

4. **Flash TWRP (Temporary Boot):** Execute the following command in your computer's command prompt or terminal: `fastboot boot twrp.img` (replace "twrp.img" with the name of the downloaded TWRP file). This will temporarily boot TWRP without permanently installing it.
5. **Flash TWRP (Permanent Installation):** Once TWRP boots up, transfer your stock boot image to your device's storage (internal, SD card, or USB OTG). In TWRP, go to "Install," select the stock boot image, and flash it to both slots. Then, navigate to "Advanced" > "Flash Current TWRP" to install TWRP permanently.
