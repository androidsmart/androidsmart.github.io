The Redmi Note 7 Pro, launched in 2019, remains a popular budget smartphone known for its capable hardware and value proposition. However, its official software support has ended, leaving users with an outdated Android version and no new features. 

This is where LineageOS comes in. LineageOS is a free, open-source operating system based on Android. It's known for its clean interface, improved performance, and enhanced privacy features. 

## Bringing LineageOS 21 to the Redmi Note 7 Pro

A group of dedicated developers has successfully ported LineageOS 21, based on Android 11, to the Redmi Note 7 Pro. This allows users to enjoy the latest Android features and security updates on their device.

2. **Technical Skills:** Installing LineageOS requires some technical knowledge and experience.
