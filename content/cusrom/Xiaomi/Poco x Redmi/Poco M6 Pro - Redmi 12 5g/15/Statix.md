Download Custom Rom Statix OS Android 15 Xiaomi Redmi 12 5G and Poco M6 pro (Sky).

StatixOS is a custom Android-based ROM AOSP for its focus on providing a clean, customizable, and efficient user experience. Here’s what to expect when running Android 15-based StatixOS on the POCO M6 Pro 5G.

## Features and Benefits of StatixOS

StatixOS emphasizes performance and fluidity, often improving system resource management compared to MIUI (the default software on POCO devices). It features customizable quick settings, a clean user interface without bloatware, and extensive theming options. Users will appreciate a more stock-Android feel combined with some performance optimizations and tweaks that make StatixOS stand out.

## POCO M6 Pro 5G Overview

The POCO M6 Pro 5G is a budget-friendly device powered by the Qualcomm Snapdragon 4 Gen 2 chipset, offering decent performance for everyday tasks. It has a 6.79-inch IPS LCD display with a 90Hz refresh rate, and a robust 5,000mAh battery, though it only supports 18W fast charging, which is relatively slow by today’s standards. The dual-camera setup on the back includes a 50MP main sensor and a 2MP depth sensor, providing solid performance in well-lit conditions but struggling in low-light scenarios. An 8MP front camera handles selfies adequately.

Running a custom ROM like StatixOS on the POCO M6 Pro can unlock additional features and potentially improve performance by offering a lighter and more refined software experience. However, keep in mind that transitioning to a custom ROM might void your warranty and requires technical know-how.
