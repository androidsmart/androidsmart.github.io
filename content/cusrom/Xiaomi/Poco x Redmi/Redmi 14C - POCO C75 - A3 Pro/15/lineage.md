The Redmi 14C, POCO C75, and A3 Pro are budget-friendly smartphones sharing a common lineage, offering decent specs at affordable prices.  While their manufacturer-provided software experience may vary, there's a thriving community dedicated to providing alternative operating systems like LineageOS. LineageOS 22, based on Android 15, is a popular choice known for its clean interface, enhanced privacy, and customizability.

## Why Choose LineageOS 22

## Installation and Considerations

Installing LineageOS requires unlocking your phone's bootloader and flashing a custom recovery, such as TWRP.
