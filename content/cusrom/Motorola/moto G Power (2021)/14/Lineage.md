**A Guide to Installing LineageOS 21 on your Moto G Power (2021)**

The Moto G Power (2021) is a budget-friendly phone with decent specs, but it can be even better with a custom ROM like LineageOS. LineageOS is an open-source operating system based on Android that offers a clean, bloatware-free experience with enhanced privacy and customization features. In this article, we'll guide you through the process of installing LineageOS 21 on your Moto G Power (2021).

## Disclaimer

* This process involves unlocking your bootloader, which will void your warranty and erase all data on your device. **Make sure to back up everything important before proceeding.**
* We are not responsible for any damage caused to your device. Proceed at your own risk.

## Prerequisites

* Moto G Power (2021) with an unlocked bootloader.
* A computer with ADB and Fastboot drivers installed.
* A USB cable to connect your phone to your computer.
* LineageOS 21 ROM for Moto G Power (2021) (download from the official LineageOS website or a trusted source).
* Google Apps package (optional, if you want Google services like Play Store).
* TWRP recovery image for Moto G Power (2021).

## Steps

1. **Enable Developer Options and USB Debugging:** Go to Settings > About Phone and tap on the Build Number seven times to enable Developer Options. Then, go to Settings > System > Developer Options and enable USB Debugging.

2. **Unlock the Bootloader:**
    * Connect your phone to your computer via USB.
    * Open a command prompt or terminal window and navigate to the directory where you have ADB and Fastboot installed.
    * Boot your phone into fastboot mode by running the command `adb reboot bootloader`.
    * Once your phone is in fastboot mode, run the command `fastboot devices` to verify that your device is recognized.
    * Run the command `fastboot oem get_unlock_data`. This will output a long string of characters. Copy this string.
    * Go to the Motorola website and follow the instructions to unlock your bootloader. You will need to paste the string you copied in the previous step.
    * Once you receive the unlock code, run the command `fastboot flashing unlock <unlock code>`.
    * **Warning:** This will erase all data on your phone.

3. **Install TWRP Recovery:**
    * Download the TWRP recovery image for your device.
    * Rename the image file to `recovery.img` and place it in the same directory as your ADB and Fastboot files.
    * In the command prompt or terminal window, run the command `fastboot flash recovery recovery.img`.
    * Once the flashing process is complete, reboot your phone into recovery mode by holding the power button and volume down button simultaneously.

4. **Install LineageOS and GApps:**
    * Boot your phone into TWRP recovery.
    * In TWRP, go to Wipe > Advanced Wipe and select Dalvik / ART Cache, System, Data, and Cache. Swipe to wipe.
    * Go back to the main menu and select Install.
    * Navigate to the LineageOS 21 ROM zip file and select it.
    * If you want to install Google Apps, also select the GApps zip file.
    * Swipe to confirm the installation.
    * Once the installation is complete, reboot your phone.

## First Boot
