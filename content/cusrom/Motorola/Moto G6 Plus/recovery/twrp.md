## TWRP Recovery for Motorola Moto G6 Plus: A Comprehensive Guide

Team Win Recovery Project (TWRP) is a custom recovery environment that offers advanced features for Android devices, including the Motorola Moto G6 Plus (codenamed evert).

**How to Install TWRP on Your Moto G6 Plus**

**Installation Steps:**

1. **Enable USB Debugging:** Go to "Settings" > "About Phone" and tap "Build Number" seven times to enable Developer Options. Then go to "Developer Options" and enable "USB Debugging."
2. **Boot into Fastboot Mode:** Connect your phone to your computer and run the following command in a terminal or command prompt window:

```bash
adb reboot bootloader
```

3. **Flash TWRP:** Once your phone is in Fastboot mode, run the following command:

```bash
fastboot boot path/to/twrp.img
```

Replace "path/to/twrp.img" with the actual path to the TWRP image file. This will temporarily boot TWRP on your device.

4. **Backup Stock Recovery:** In TWRP, go to "Backup" and create a backup of your stock recovery (just in case you want to revert later).
5. **Flash TWRP Permanently:** In TWRP, go to "Install" and select the TWRP image file. Swipe to confirm the flash.
6. **Reboot:** Reboot your phone to the system. TWRP should now be installed permanently.

**Note:** Monthly security updates may break decryption of /data in TWRP. MTP does not work at this time, but you can use ADB to transfer files.

**Disclaimer:** Modifying your device can void your warranty and may cause issues if not done properly. Proceed at your own risk.

By following this guide, you can successfully install TWRP on your Motorola Moto G6 Plus and enjoy the benefits of custom recovery.
