## Project Elixir Android 14 for Nokia 6.1: An Early Access Custom ROM

Project Elixir, a well-regarded custom ROM known for its minimal UI enhancements and close-to-stock Android experience, has released an early access version of its Android 14 build for the Nokia 6.1 (codenamed PL2).

**What to Expect:**

* **Early Access:** This is an early access release, meaning it's still under development and may contain bugs or instability.
* **Android 14 Features:** Users can expect to try out the latest Android 14 features on their Nokia 6.1, including improved privacy controls, a refined user interface, and enhanced performance optimizations.
* **Project Elixir Enhancements:** Project Elixir typically adds its own subtle enhancements to the stock Android experience, focusing on performance, security, and stability.

**Important Notes:**

* **Maintainer Availability:** The continued development of this ROM depends on the availability of the device maintainer.
* **Installation:** Installing custom ROMs requires unlocking the bootloader, which voids the device warranty.
* **Bugs and Issues:** Early access releases are prone to bugs and issues. Be prepared for potential problems and report them to the developers.

**How to Install:**

Detailed installation instructions can be found on the official Project Elixir website:
