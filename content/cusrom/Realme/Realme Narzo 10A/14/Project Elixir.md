## Is It Right for Me?

If you're comfortable with custom ROMs and like the idea of a pure Android experience, Project Elixir is an excellent choice. However, installing a custom ROM requires some technical know-how and voids your device's warranty. It's essential to follow the installation instructions carefully and back up your data before proceeding.

## How to Get Started

**Important:** Proceed at your own risk. Unlocking your bootloader and installing a custom ROM can potentially damage your device.

1. **Do Your Research:** Carefully read the installation guides and device-specific instructions on the official Project Elixir website and forums.
2. **Unlock Bootloader:**  This is usually the first step in installing a custom ROM.
3. **Install a Custom Recovery:**  This allows you to flash the ROM onto your device. TWRP (Team Win Recovery Project) is a popular choice.
4. **Download the ROM:**  Get the latest Project Elixir Android 14 ROM for the Narzo 10A from their official download page.
5. **Flash the ROM:**  Follow the detailed instructions to flash the ROM using your custom recovery.
6. **Enjoy Android 14:**  Once installed, reboot your device, and you'll be greeted with the latest Android version.

## Where to Find Help

If you run into any issues or have questions, the Project Elixir community is a valuable resource. They have forums and Telegram groups where you can seek assistance.

## Disclaimer

Remember, installing custom ROMs is an advanced procedure and carries inherent risks. Proceed with caution and ensure you understand the process fully before starting.
