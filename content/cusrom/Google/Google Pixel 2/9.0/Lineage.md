Download Custom Rom Lineage 16 OS android 9.0 Google Pixel 2 (walleye).

LineageOS is a free and open-source operating system for set-top boxes, smartphones and tablet computers, based on the Android mobile platform.

**** This is an unofficial ROM.. Install at your own risk! ****â€‹


The ROM has been stable for me and I use it as a daily driver. However, if you encounter any instabilities or bugs, please do post in this thread.

## Installation Instructions
### First install, coming from stock
1. Before you start: Backup everything on your device before you start. You will delete all data during the installation.
2. Install the August 2019 factory image for the Pixel 2. I used Deuce's script for flashing.
3. Boot to TWRP (I used twrp-3.3.0-0)
4. Wipe data and 'Dalvik/'Art Cache' in TWRP - Wipe - Advanced Wipe
5. Install the zip and optionally install TWRP and reboot. Take note of the slot you installed the ROM to in the Reboot menu.

### Upgrade to new version
1. Boot to TWRP
2. Flash the new zip that you downloaded from the links below (no need to wipe data)
3. Optionally flash TWRP
4. Reboot
