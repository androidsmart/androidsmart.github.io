Download Custom Recovery TWRP Latest version for Google Pixel 3 XL (crosshatch)


TWRP is a custom recovery for Android devices. It replaces the stock recovery, providing more advanced features and functionalities. Essentially, it's a bootable environment that allows you to perform various system-level operations, including:

* **Installing custom ROMs:**  Flashing custom ROMs like LineageOS or Pixel Experience to customize your phone's software.
* **Creating and restoring backups:** Making complete backups of your phone's system (known as NANDroid backups) and restoring them if needed.
* **Rooting your device:** Gaining root access for more control over your phone's system.
* **Installing custom kernels and mods:**  Flashing custom kernels for performance enhancements or installing various mods to add new features.
* **Wiping data and partitions:** Performing factory resets or wiping specific partitions like cache or dalvik cache.
* **Sideloading ZIP files:** Installing updates or modifications manually from your computer.

## Why Install TWRP on Google Pixel 3 XL?

Installing TWRP on your Pixel 3 XL opens up a world of customization possibilities. Here are some key reasons why you might consider it:

* **Custom ROMs:** Install custom ROMs to change the entire look and feel of your phone's software, add new features, and remove bloatware.
* **Enhanced Backups:** Create comprehensive backups of your phone's system, ensuring you can always revert to a working state if something goes wrong.
* **Root Access:** Gain root access to install powerful apps, tweak system settings, and have more control over your device.
* **Modding and Customization:** Install custom kernels, mods, and themes to personalize your phone and enhance its performance.

## Installing TWRP on Google Pixel 3 XL

**Disclaimer:** Installing custom recovery and modifying your phone's software can void your warranty and potentially brick your device. Proceed with caution and at your own risk.

## Prerequisites

* **Unlocked Bootloader:** Your Pixel 3 XL must have an unlocked bootloader.
* **ADB and Fastboot:** Install ADB (Android Debug Bridge) and Fastboot on your computer. These tools are used to communicate with your phone in fastboot mode.
* **TWRP Image:** Download the latest TWRP image file specifically for the Google Pixel 3 XL from the official TWRP website.
* **USB Cable:** A USB cable to connect your phone to your computer.
* **Enable USB Debugging:** Enable USB debugging in your phone's Developer Options.

## Steps

1. **Boot into Fastboot Mode:**
   - Power off your Pixel 3 XL.
   - Press and hold the Power button and Volume Down button simultaneously until you see the Fastboot Mode screen.

2. **Connect to Computer:**
   - Connect your phone to your computer using the USB cable.

3. **Open a Command Prompt/Terminal:**
   - On your computer, open a command prompt or terminal window and navigate to the directory where you downloaded the TWRP image file.

4. **Flash TWRP:**
   - Type the following command and press Enter:
     ```
     fastboot flash recovery twrp-x.x.x-crosshatch.img 
     ```
     (Replace `twrp-x.x.x-crosshatch.img` with the actual filename of the TWRP image.)

5. **Boot into TWRP:**
   - While your phone is still in Fastboot Mode, use the volume buttons to navigate to "Recovery Mode" and press the Power button to select it.
   - Your phone should now boot into TWRP recovery.

6. **(Optional) Root your device:**
   - If you want to root your phone, you can flash a Magisk ZIP file from TWRP.

## Important Notes

* **First boot into TWRP:** The first time you boot into TWRP after installation, it might ask you if you want to allow modifications to the system partition. **It's crucial to swipe right to allow modifications** if you plan on installing custom ROMs or rooting your device. Otherwise, TWRP will remain in read-only mode.
* **Keep TWRP:**  If you want to keep TWRP after flashing a custom ROM, you usually need to flash it again immediately after flashing the ROM. This is because some ROMs might replace TWRP with the stock recovery.
