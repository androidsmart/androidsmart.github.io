The Google Pixel Tablet, released in 2023, is a powerful and versatile device designed for both productivity and entertainment. While it comes with Android 13 out of the box, tech enthusiasts and power users might be interested in exploring custom ROM options like LineageOS 21.

## What is LineageOS?

LineageOS is a free and open-source operating system for various devices, based on the Android mobile platform. It is known for its stability, performance, and customizability, offering features and enhancements not found in stock Android builds.

## LineageOS 21 and the Google Pixel Tablet

While LineageOS 21 isn't officially supported for the Google Pixel Tablet yet, the development community is actively working on bringing this custom ROM to the device. Here's what you can expect:

## Potential Benefits
