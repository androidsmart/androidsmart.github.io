The Google Pixel XL, released back in 2016, was a flagship phone of its time. But as the years passed, it was inevitably left behind in the Android update cycle.  However, thanks to the dedicated developers at LineageOS, the Pixel XL can now experience the latest Android version with all its modern features and improvements.

**LineageOS 21.0**, based on Android 14, is now officially available for the Google Pixel XL. This brings a slew of enhancements, including:

LineageOS is a popular open-source operating system known for its stability, performance, and customizability. It offers a clean and bloatware-free Android experience while providing advanced features and customization options.
