  * **Create and restore backups:** Safeguard your data with comprehensive backups (NANDroid) before experimenting with your phone.
  * **Flash ZIP files:** Install mods, kernels, and other enhancements to customize your phone's functionality.
  * **Wipe data:** Perform factory resets, clear cache, and selectively wipe data partitions.
  * **Advanced features:** Access file management, terminal emulation, and other powerful tools.
