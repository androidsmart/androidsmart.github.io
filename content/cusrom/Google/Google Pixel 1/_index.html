Google announced the release of the Pixel smartphone in October 2016. While manufactured by HTC, the Pixel is entirely Google's own design. The flagship device features a 5.0" FHD AMOLED display, with a pixel density of 441ppi, and a Gorilla Glass 4 coating. It's powered by a Qualcomm Snapdragon 821 chipset, comprised of a quad-core 2.15Ghz Kryo CPU, Adreno 530 GPU, and 4GB of RAM. It comes with a choice of either 32GB or 128GB internal storage, but does lack a removable storage slot. On the rear of the Pixel sits a 12MP camera, with f/2.0 aperture, phase detection autofocus, and 4K video recording. The front selfie camera has an 8MP sensor, with f/2.0 aperture, and FHD video. The Google Pixel runs on a non-removable 2770mAh battery, with fast charging capability, and uses a USB Type-C connector. On the exterior, the Pixel has an aluminium unibody, with a large polished glass panel on the rear, surrounding the camera lens, flash, and a fingerprint sensor. Google's Live Cases are also available for the Pixel. The device is the first to feature Google Assistant, a voice activated assistant, that integrates Google now. It's also the first device to ship with Android 7.1.
