* **Rooting your device:** Gain root access for system-level modifications and customization.
* **Flashing ZIP files:** Install various modifications, including custom kernels, mods, and add-ons.
* **Wiping data:** Perform factory resets, clear cache, and selectively wipe data partitions.

Installing TWRP on your Google Pixel 1 opens up a world of customization possibilities. Here are some key benefits:

* **Custom ROMs:** Install custom ROMs like LineageOS, Pixel Experience, and Paranoid Android to experience different Android versions, features, and user interfaces.
