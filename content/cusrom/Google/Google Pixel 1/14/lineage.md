If you don't follow these instructions, or use 3rd party add-ons (like Magisk) please don't expect support here.

## Known Bugs
Sound Trigger (Screen-off "Hey Google" detection) is nonfunctional due to incompatibilities with older proprietary binaries, and lack of system space for needed Google Apps.
Find any? Report them according to this guide.

## Notes
- Firmware is shipped in the ROM package for this device, so no need to worry about updating it on your own!
- This uses a port of Linux kernel version 4.4 by @rootfan - thanks!
- This requires a repartition - please see the wiki install guide(s) linked above on how to repartition! Our repartition script it different from other packages, please run ours!
- The only supported GApps package at the moment is MindTheGapps, linked on our Wiki page about gapps.
