The Google Pixel 3a, a beloved budget phone from 2019, may have reached its official end-of-life in terms of software updates, but thanks to the dedicated developer community, it can still enjoy the latest Android experience.  Pixel Experience, a popular custom ROM, has brought Android 13 to the Pixel 3a, breathing new life into this aging device.

## What is Pixel Experience

Pixel Experience is an AOSP-based custom ROM that aims to provide a Pixel-like experience on a wide range of devices. It focuses on delivering a clean and smooth Android experience with minimal bloatware, along with some useful customization options.

## Android 13 on the Pixel 3a

  * **Updated Material You design:**  Enjoy a more personalized look with dynamic color theming that adapts to your wallpaper.
  * **Improved privacy controls:** Take more control over what data apps can access, with granular permission settings and a privacy dashboard.
  * **Enhanced notification management:**  Manage notifications more effectively with improved grouping and snoozing options.
  * **Performance improvements:** Experience smoother performance and better battery life thanks to under-the-hood optimizations.

## Things to Keep in Mind

While Pixel Experience offers a great way to experience Android 13 on the Pixel 3a, there are a few things to keep in mind:

  * **Installation:** Installing a custom ROM requires unlocking the bootloader and flashing the ROM, which can be a complex process for those unfamiliar with it.
  * **Bugs:** As with any custom ROM, there might be occasional bugs or stability issues.
  * **SafetyNet:**  Some apps that rely on SafetyNet, like banking apps, may not work properly on a custom ROM.

## Overall

If you're a Pixel 3a owner looking to give your phone a new lease on life and experience the latest Android version, Pixel Experience is definitely worth considering. It offers a near-stock Android experience with the added benefits of Android 13.  Just be sure to do your research and proceed with caution if you're new to custom ROMs.
