Download Custom Rom lineage 16.0 OS android 9.0 Google Pixel 3 (Blueline).

This is an unofficial build of LineageOS for the Pixel 3 (blueline). I always liked Lineage (and its predecessor CyanogenMOD) as well as the Google line of phones. Unfortunately having a Google Pixel phone isn't certainty for a lot of custom ROMS anymore, so that's why I decided to compile my own version. It's been quite challeging, but I think I finally have a build that is good enough to share.
