Download Custom Rom Resurrection Remix OS android 8.1 Google Pixel 2 XL (taimen).

Resurrection Remix the ROM has been based on LOS, Slim, Omni, DU and original Remix ROM builds, this creates an awesome combination of performance, customization, power and the most new features, brought directly to your Device

## Install
This rom is based on the stock oreo 8.1 OPM2.171019.029 April 2018 rom from Google. The instructions below assume your device is already on that rom. This is important because your device needs to have the vendor, radio, bootloader, and other img's from that rom. So, if you need to, flash the OPM2.171019.029 stock rom first. If coming from previous RR build simply follow instructions.

Taimen factory images​

Both TWRP 3.2.0-0 and TWRP 3.2.1-2 have been confirmed working.

IMPORTANT NOTE: Twrp version 3.2.0-0 can't decrypt data if it's secured with pin, password, etc. So, before you begin go to lockscreen security settings and change it to 'none' or 'swipe'.

1. boot into twrp and factory reset
2. flash rom zip
3. flash twrp zip
Reboot & enjoy.​

All builds from here on out will be completely Root-less. We have decided as a TEAM its best to let you the users decide what you want on your devices. So if you want/need Root access please flash either Magisk or SU.
