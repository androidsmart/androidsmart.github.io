**Evolution X Brings Android 14 to Google Pixel 4: A New Lease on Life**

The Google Pixel 4, despite being a capable device, reached its end-of-life with Android 13. However, the custom ROM community, particularly the Evolution X project, has stepped up to breathe new life into the phone by porting Android 14.

## What is Evolution X?

## Evolution X and Android 14 on Pixel 4

The Evolution X team has successfully ported Android 14 to the Pixel 4, allowing users to enjoy the latest features and improvements.
