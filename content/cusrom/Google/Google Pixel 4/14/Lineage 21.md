## How to Install LineageOS 21 on Google Pixel 4

1. **Unlock Bootloader:** Before installing LineageOS, you'll need to unlock your Pixel 4's bootloader. This process will erase all data on your device, so back up your important files.
2. **Install Custom Recovery:** Next, you'll need to install a custom recovery like TWRP (Team Win Recovery Project). This will allow you to flash LineageOS onto your device.
3. **Download LineageOS and GApps:** Download the appropriate LineageOS 21 build for your Pixel 4 and the Google Apps (GApps) package if you want to use Google services.
4. **Flash LineageOS and GApps:** Boot into TWRP recovery and flash the LineageOS zip file, followed by the GApps zip file if you downloaded it.
5. **Reboot and Enjoy:** After flashing, reboot your Pixel 4. It may take a few minutes to boot up for the first time, but once it does, you'll be greeted with a fresh, new LineageOS experience.

**Important Note:** Installing a custom ROM like LineageOS will void your warranty. Proceed with caution and make sure you follow the instructions carefully to avoid any issues.
