The Google Pixel 4, although a few years old, remains a beloved device for many. Thankfully, the Android community is dedicated to extending its life, and one such way is through custom ROMs like PixelOS Android 14.

**What is PixelOS?**

**Installing PixelOS on Your Pixel 4**

Before proceeding, it's important to note that installing a custom ROM like PixelOS requires unlocking the bootloader of your Pixel 4, which will wipe your data. Make sure to back up all your important information before you begin.

1. **Unlock Bootloader:**  Follow the official instructions from Google to unlock your bootloader.
2. **Install Custom Recovery:** A custom recovery like TWRP is needed to flash the PixelOS ROM.
