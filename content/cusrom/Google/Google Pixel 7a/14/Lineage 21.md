## Installing LineageOS 21: Your Journey Begins

Before you begin, remember to research and prepare carefully. Installing custom ROMs involves risks, so back up your data and thoroughly understand the process:

1. **Unlock the Bootloader:** Follow the specific instructions for your Pixel 7a (codename: lynx) to unlock the bootloader. This step is essential for installing custom ROMs.
2. **Install Custom Recovery:** Opt for a reliable custom recovery like TWRP (Team Win Recovery Project), a versatile tool for flashing LineageOS and other custom ROMs.
3. **Download LineageOS 21:** Head to the official LineageOS website and find the build specifically designed for your Pixel 7a.
4. **Flash LineageOS:** Boot into TWRP recovery, wipe your device's data (a crucial step), and then flash the downloaded LineageOS ZIP file.
5. **Google Apps (Optional):** If you can't live without the Google Play Store and other Google apps, flash the corresponding GApps package after installing LineageOS.
6. **Reboot & Revel:** Restart your device, and you'll be welcomed into the world of LineageOS 21 on your Pixel 7a.

## A Word of Caution

Custom ROM installation comes with inherent risks. Always back up your data, research thoroughly, and proceed with caution. If you're unsure, seek guidance from experienced users or online communities.
