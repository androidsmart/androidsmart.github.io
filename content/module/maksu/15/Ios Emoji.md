iOS Emoji for Android can be installed using Magisk or KernelSU modules. These modules replace the default Android emojis with iOS-style emojis, giving your device a more Apple-like look and feel.

**Magisk Module:**

* This is the most common method, and works with most Android devices. 
* You can find Magisk modules for iOS Emoji on GitHub and XDA Forums.
* To install, simply download the module zip file and flash it in the Magisk app.

**KernelSU Module:**

* KernelSU is a newer alternative to Magisk, and offers similar functionality.
* iOS Emoji modules for KernelSU are also available on GitHub.
* Installation is similar to Magisk, but requires flashing the module through KernelSU.

**Key Points:**

* Both methods are relatively easy to use, even for those without extensive technical knowledge.
* Make sure to download modules from trusted sources, as modified versions could potentially harm your device.
* Always create a backup before flashing any modules, in case something goes wrong.
