Pixel Xpert is a module for rooted Pixel phones running Android 13 and later, designed to unlock customizations not natively available on your device. It's a combined Xposed and Magisk module, offering a range of tweaks and adjustments.

**Description**

* **System Modifications:** Pixel Xpert enables you to modify various system settings, such as adjusting animations, changing UI elements, and tweaking system behavior.
* **Customization:** You can personalize your Pixel phone further with additional options for theming, fonts, and other visual adjustments.
* **Expanded Features:** The module unlocks hidden features or settings that are not accessible by default, giving you more control over your phone.

**How to Use**

1. **Prerequisites:** Ensure your Pixel phone is rooted with Magisk and has LSposed (or an equivalent Xposed framework) installed.
2. **Installation:** Download the Pixel Xpert module and install it through the Magisk Manager app.
3. **Activation:** After installation, reboot your phone. Pixel Xpert should automatically activate within LSposed. If it doesn't, manually activate it and reboot again.
