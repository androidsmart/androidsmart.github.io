# Benchkit

Benchkit is a developer-centric toolkit module for Android with a plethora of tools for in-depth profiling and benchmarking. Many of the tools are focused on kernel benchmarking, but userspace (i.e. Android) benchmarking is also covered by some of them. This module aims to make empirical data-driven development more accessible so people can make optimal tuning decisions based on real results.

The only supported CPU architecture is little-endian AArch64, which includes almost all modern Android phones.

## Contents

Command-line utilities:

- [Bonnie++](https://doc.coker.com.au/projects/bonnie/):
  General filesystem and I/O benchmark
- [callbench](https://github.com/kdrag0n/callbench):
  Measure the speed of simple time syscalls (with and without vDSO) and basic in-memory I/O using `mmap(2)` and `read(2)`. A 32-bit version is available as `callbench32` for 32-bit vDSO testing.
- [cyclictest](https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/utils/rt-tests/rt-tests.git/tree/src/cyclictest/cyclictest.c?h=stable/devel/v1.0.1):
  Measure timer jitter, useful for real-time latency testing

- [hyperfine](https://github.com/sharkdp/hyperfine):
  Advanced benchmark runner that makes it easy to run benchmarks in a
  statistically sound manner and export results into machine-readable formats
- [synthmark](https://github.com/google/synthmark):
  Benchmark CPU performance with real-time audio workloads (by Google; CLI version)

Android apps:
