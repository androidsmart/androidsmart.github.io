Want to unleash the full power of your smartphone camera? The 4K60 Camera Mod Magisk Module might be just what you need. This module allows you to bypass software limitations and enable 4K video recording at 60 frames per second (fps) on devices that don't officially support it. 

## What is the 4K60 Camera Mod

This Magisk Module modifies system files related to your phone's camera, unlocking higher video resolutions and frame rates. It's particularly popular for older Samsung Galaxy devices (S7, S8, Note 8) with Exynos processors, where 4K60 recording was often artificially limited.

## Features

* **4K@60fps Recording:** The headline feature, enabling ultra-high definition video recording at a smooth 60fps.
* **Higher Bitrates:**  Potentially increase video bitrate for improved quality.
* **HEVC Encoding:**  Enable more efficient HEVC (H.265) video encoding for smaller file sizes.
* **Custom Resolutions:** Access other resolutions like QHD@120fps, depending on your device.
* **Pro Mode Enhancements:** Unlock features like higher ISO values and longer shutter speeds in Pro mode.
