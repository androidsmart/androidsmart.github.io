A Magisk module changing audio samplerates at the system-wide mixer for the best Hi-Fi experience

This module has been developed for casual music lovers to be able to experience the essence of my root script ["USB SampleRate Changer"](https://github.com/yzyhk904/USB_SampleRate_Changer) by the automation of Magisk.

## Its features
1. Setting the samplerate of the USB HAL audio driver to be maximum automatically (up to 768 kHz & 32 bits; but 192 kHz & 32 bits for Tensor devices only)
2. Setting its USB data transfer period to be 2000 usec for reducing jitter, instead of usual 5000 usec
3. Setting the samplerate of the AOSP Bluetooth audio driver automatically depending upon a selected codec without double re-sampling unlike offload drivers
4. Setting the samplerate of internal speakers to be maximum; 384 kHz & 32 bits for Qcom devices, 48 kHz & 32 bits for others
5. Default re-sampling parameters are the same as <a href="https://github.com/Magisk-Modules-Alt-Repo/resampling-for-cheapies">"Resampling for cheapies"</a> (can be overridden by other modules), i.e., very mastering level quality being much better than the over-sammpling quality of very expensive DAC's applied when "The bit-perfect mode"
6. Optimizing I/O kernel tunables for reducing jitter (most effective and almost safe as kernel tuning)</li>
7. Designed for using <a href="https://github.com/Magisk-Modules-Alt-Repo/audio-misc-settings">"Audio Msic. Settings"</a> or <a href="https://github.com/yzyhk904/hifi-maximizer-mod">"Hifi maximizer"</a> together, but can be used by itself only
8. Since the above two modules override re-sampling parameters, use <a href="https://github.com/Magisk-Modules-Alt-Repo/resampling-for-cheapies">"Resampling for cheapies"</a> in addition if you use cheapie devices (Bluetooth LDAC earphones, cheap USB DAC's, and internal speakers, etc.)
9. Strongly recommending to install <a href="https://github.com/Magisk-Modules-Alt-Repo/audio-jitter-silencer">"Audio jitter silencer"</a> together and uninstall (or disable) "Digital Wellbeing" app (for reducing very large jitters which this module cannot reduce by itself)!
10. Disabling DRC (a kind of compression) if enabled, and the call screening framework under audio HAL's for reducing jitter


## Notes
* This module can run only on devices using a 7.0 audio policy configuration prevailing since Android 14 or so including custom ROM's supporting relatively old ones (especially phh GSI's doing since Android 12), excluding recent AIDL only ones like Pixel 9 series.
* This module has been tested on LineageOS and crDroid ROM's, and phh GSI's (Android 14, and Qualcomm SoC & MediaTek SoC & Tensors combinations). 
* Also don't forget disabling "Absolute Volume" of Bluetooth devices in developer settings and setting a volume at the Bluetooth devices side to be maximum for the best audio quality, though most people may think inversely.
* Almost all equalizers and some apps (using a much worse internal re-sampler to output; e.g. old Am@zon music app, some VOIP apps, etc.) cannot work for greater than 192 kHz audio outputs (but of which quality is far better sometimes). And the latest Am@zon music app re-samples up to 192 kHz for such high frequency audio output, i.e. incurs much worse double re-sampling. If you prefer such ones, modify `SampleRatePrimary="384000"` to `SampleRatePrimary="192000"` or even `SampleRatePrimary="48000"` (these samplerates affect only internal speakers and wired headsets), and also the third argument of `patchClearLock` command from "max" (means up to 768 kHz) to "default" (does up to 192 kHz) in "customize.sh" in a ZIP file of this module and install (or update) the modified one.
* <a href="https://github.com/Magisk-Modules-Alt-Repo/drc-remover">"DRC remover"</a> and <a href="https://github.com/Magisk-Modules-Alt-Repo/usb-samplerate-unlocker">"USB Samplerate Unlocker"</a> are already  included; Don't try installing them together</li>
