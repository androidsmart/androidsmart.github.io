The Zip & ZipSigner for Android NDK module is a tool primarily designed for developers working with Android apps and system modifications. It provides the necessary tools to sign and align ZIP files, which is a crucial step in making Android packages installable.

**Key features:**

* **Zipsigner:** A Java-based tool used to digitally sign APK (Android Package Kit) files and other ZIP files. Signing ensures the authenticity and integrity of the package.
* **Zipalign:** A tool that optimizes ZIP files to improve the way Android loads them, potentially reducing memory usage and improving performance.
* **Wrapped dexed zipsigner.jar:** A pre-compiled version of the zipsigner tool included in the module for convenience.
* **Static binaries:** Pre-compiled versions of the zip and zipalign tools for ARM and ARM64 architectures, eliminating the need for additional dependencies.

**How to use:**

1. **Install the module:** Download the module from the Magisk Modules Repo ([https://github.com/Magisk-Modules-Repo/zipsigner](https://github.com/Magisk-Modules-Repo/zipsigner)) and install it using a Magisk module installer.
2. **Access the tools:** After installation, the zipsigner, zip, and zipalign tools will be available in your device's command-line environment.
3. **Sign a ZIP file:** Use the following command to sign a ZIP file (e.g., an APK):
   ```bash
   zipsigner -sigFile CERT.RSA -keyFile CERT.PK8 input.zip signed.zip
   ```
   Replace `CERT.RSA` and `CERT.PK8` with your signing certificate and private key files, and `input.zip` with the ZIP file you want to sign.
4. **Align a ZIP file:** Use the following command to align a ZIP file:
   ```bash
   zipalign -v 4 signed.zip aligned.zip
   ```
   Replace `signed.zip` with the signed ZIP file.

**Additional notes:**

* The module is primarily intended for users with a basic understanding of Android development and command-line tools.
* If you're unsure how to generate signing certificates, consult Android developer documentation for instructions.
* For detailed instructions and support, refer to the module's XDA thread ([https://xdaforums.com/t/tools-zips-scripts-osm0sis-odds-and-ends-multiple-](https://xdaforums.com/t/tools-zips-scripts-osm0sis-odds-and-ends-multiple-)).
