OT - one-time - after installing the module, the script is executed once, then the script and module deletes itself completely (except for the log file)

D - daily - the script is executed after each device reboot without complete removal.

## Dex Optimization

The dex optimizer. Improves performance, saves resources and reduces application startup time. The average script execution time is ~50 minutes (for me personally, script completed in 25 minutes on poco f5). Once all processes are completed, a notification will appear. Successful execution can be seen in the logs, it should look like this: [package] success
