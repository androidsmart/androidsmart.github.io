AirMusic (formerly known as AirAudio) is an Android app that allows you to stream audio from your device to network-enabled receivers. It offers a Magisk module that enables "root recording," allowing you to stream all audio, including system sounds.

**Magisk Module**

The AirMusic Magisk module can be found on GitHub: [https://github.com/Magisk-Modules-Repo/airmusic](https://github.com/Magisk-Modules-Repo/airmusic)

To use this module, you need:

1. **AirMusic App:** Install the AirMusic app from Google Play Store.
2. **Magisk:** Have Magisk installed and operational on your Android device.

**KernelSU Module**

Currently, there isn't an official AirMusic module specifically for KernelSU. However, since KernelSU's module system is similar to Magisk, it's possible that the Magisk module could work with KernelSU with some modifications. You could try installing it as a KernelSU module, but there's no guarantee of compatibility.
