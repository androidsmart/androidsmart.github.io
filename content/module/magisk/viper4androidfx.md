This time I discuss the Magisk module which is quite popular among the Android community, namely viper4android FX which was ported as the Magisk module and KSU module by several developers, so this module functions to add a manual audio equalizer to the speakers or handsets of our devices.

We must try the Viper4Android FX module on Android because when we play music we can enjoy audio that is more suited to our ears. Viper4Android FX is a good option for setting the audio equalizer on our device when listening to music.  and adjust between bass, treble and several effects that we can activate or deactivate in the viper4android fx settings.

Viper4android fx was created by [zhuhang](https://xdaforums.com/t/app-official-viper4android-audio-effects-fx-v2-5-0-5-new-features-7-0-support.2191223/) and *ViPER520* developer recognized by @xda-developer then developed and ported by ``ahrion`` and ``Zackptg5`` as an installation that supports *systemless* and other *non systemless* support:

**Architecture** : *arm32, arm64, x86, x86_64*

**Android version** : *2.2 hingga android 14.0*

We should thank the developers for continuing to update the viper4androidfx project so that it can continue to be compatible with new Android versions, and also the effects that we can feel are very pronounced, especially if you use a handset.

**Viper4android** is a solution for users who want to improve the audio experience on their Android devices, Viper4android has actually not been updated for a long time by the original developer, but several [xda developers](https://xdaforums.com/t/app-all-root-solutions-6-0-viper4android-fx-2-7.3774651/) has updated and made it compatible with new android versions and fixed drivers.
