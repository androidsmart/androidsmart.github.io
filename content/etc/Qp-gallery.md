## Q & A

### Why am I having synchronization problems with my cloud accounts on QuickPic?

It is important to note that the official version of QuickPic is already known to present synchronization problems. Synchronization APIs have been disabled to avoid instability. In this mod, synchronization is also not present, which can cause problems with cloud account synchronization.

### What may be causing the split action bar option to not work correctly in QuickPic?

If you are using an Android version higher than 8.1.0, there is a great chance that the split action bar option will not work due to a dependency (Theme.Holo) that is no longer available in the latest versions of Android. Unfortunately, it is not yet possible to update it to work on recent versions. Additionally, it is important to note that Xposed modules can cause it to not work properly, regardless of the Android version. Be aware that in versions above 8.1.0, this option will be hidden.

### What should I do if the app keeps closing when reopening on Android 7?

This is a known bug that is causing the app to close when reopening. Although it has been partially fixed, there are still some issues remaining. To solve this problem, you can click on the provided link to download the latest version of the mod. It is important to note that the bug fix may interrupt the main activity, which is why it has not been added yet. Keep the app updated to keep up with all fixes.

### Can QuickPic display external storage folders?

Due to changes in external storage behavior in Android 11, QuickPic cannot show external storage folders in explore mode and folder options. This is an unresolved bug in the mod, so it is recommended that you do not relate errors to this specific problem. I am working to fix this problem, and an updated version has been partially fixed. If you encounter other problems not related to this bug, do not hesitate to report them.

### I cannot install on my Pixel 7/Pixel 7 Pro, what is the issue?

QuickPic was developed exclusively to operate on smartphones that run on 32-bit architecture. Unfortunately, Pixel 7 and 7 Pro devices are only capable of supporting 64-bit apps, making QuickPic incompatible with these smartphones.

Due to the complexity of compiling the app with 64-bit support because of the absence of the project's source code, it is not possible to fix this issue.

### Why do I see a square in my image during rendering?

There is a chance that you are running an MIUI version. The problem is related to a bug in Dark Mode, and although there is a solution, it must be done manually. The following steps can be taken to solve the problem:

1. Open device settings

2. Open display settings

3. Open Dark Mode settings

4. Open "Individual apps" option

5. Uncheck QuickPic from this list.



If you encounter any problems with QuickPic, make sure to check for any updates to the mod or any known bugs causing the problem. Additionally, it is important to follow all suggested tips to ensure a smoother user experience.

### Why is QuickPic Mod not open source?

QuickPic distribution licenses forbid the release of the reverse engineered code, which can be detrimental to our app. However, there is nothing in the code that cannot be seen by decompiling with JADX or Apktool.
