Download Custom kernel Agishna for redmi note 10 pro sweet

everything is the same as the aghisna "R" version, and here I deliberately gave the code "X", not that I am a fan of elon musk, for 70% the features are the same, the rest cannot be implemented because the base kernel has unavailable headers, the rest I will apply  again periodically.

maybe there are a few bugs, because the base is from CAF especially for miui users the clock speed of the cpu on the device shows 2.9 or 3.2ghz,, that's normal doesn't mean it's overclocked and livin dead for Indonesian people, the rest you find yourself

now fully working in aryann tree
